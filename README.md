# End-to-End Testing (deprecated)
In earlier versions, Robotest offered automated Web UI based tests against the
Gravity web installer.  After [significant changes](https://github.com/gravitational/gravity/pull/424/)
to the Web UI in Gravity 6.0 these browser based tests were never updated and
have now fallen into disuse.  For more information on browser based tests see
the [e2e README](./e2e/README.md).
